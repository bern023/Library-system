INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR LIBRARY SYSTEM
1. FOR USE IN QT FRAMEWORK
2.IF IT WAS DEPLOYABLE

1.FOR USE IN QT FRAMEWORK
When the folder is downloaded from GitHub, your computer will have issues with the build folder (this is explained later).
1. To open the project in QT Creator, click open project in QT and navigate to the Library-system-2 folder.
2. There, click the CMakeLists.txt, which should open the project.
3. It will ask which kit, make sure you have and use "Desktop Qt 6.7.1 MinGW 64-bit". It may work with others but this is confirmed working.
4.--IMPORTANT-- It WILL have errors. You need to either go to the tool bar at the top and hover over Build.
5. Then click "Clear Cmake configuration" and then click "Run Cmake" just above that.
6. If that does not work go into the Library-System-2 folder, go into build, then the Qt 6.7.1 folder and delete "CMakeCache.txt".
7. Restart Qt and click Run CMake in the project.
This is done because the existing build folder is set to one of our computers file path locations and this will assign those file paths to yours.
8. Now go to Build in the tool bar, click clean project and rebuild and hit run. This should now have the app running.

>>In case this stupid line of code reappears, if theres an error with a code from some button called ...feat_book_home_2_clicked, go to the mainwindow header and delete the void function<<<

2.IF IT WAS DEPLOYABLE
1. Download the Library-systems folder.
2. Double click the library-systems.exe file
3. The app should start up.
